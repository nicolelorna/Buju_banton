            <h1>Structures we have inherited from colonial and western culture</h1>
            <p>We all know that coping up with a new culture is difficult for us.As Buju Banton states that"when you rent a house you can't change the structure".This applies to our culture though there are some of the cultures that we have inherited from colonial and Western culture like colonialism and racism<br>
            We have inherited colonialism in such a way that the cultures of our community are different.In our society boys are valued and they end up inheriting the land where it is believed that girls cannot inherit the land.Also in some societies they tend to educate boys and leave girls beacuse they have that conception that girls should be married at an earlier age and go to help the man.
            Girls do not have the power to stand up and fight for their rights and claim what belongs to them.Boys also act as the decision makers and girls decision are not valued.<br>
            We also adopted colorism where the light-skinned are more favoured than the dark-skinned.
            This is seen in Western culture where the slaves that had a lighter skin color worked inside the houses of the whites while the ones who had a darer color wrer sent to  the fields to work there wiyh harsh treatment.
           This is seen whereby the ligh-skinned people are  more favoured than the dark-skinned and at some time sthe dark-skinned can be forced to do alot of white or at sometimes the dark-skinned are looked down
        
           There is the culture of education that was adopted.We get to learn and study like the western culture always did and education is highly valued</p>
